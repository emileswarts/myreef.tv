<h1>About us</h1>

<p>
This site was developed by me Emile Swarts as a personal project to scratch an itch that I have had for a long time with regards to fishkeeping websites.</p>
<p>
		Being a reef enthusiast and a web developer, it was inevitable that I was going to create a site for my tank.	It is a free service, and the source code for the website is public for anyone to use.  If you have any suggestions on how to improve the site, please to not hesitate to let me know.
